Python scripts and data for reconstructing the source in a lensing system by:
1. Defining a pixel grid and solving the dimensionless lens equation for the source position. Here, we approximate the lensing galaxy as having a SIS profile for simplicity.
2. Approximating the source galaxy with a Sersic profile and estimating the parameters of this profile.

Also, to detect the distortions in gravitational potential that are imposed due to the different type of dark matter substructure inherent in the lensing system. This is done by non-trivially solving an anisotropic eikonal partial differential equation for the gravitational potential and finding points of inflection.
